# Win10-Network-Tuning

A modern PowerShell-based network optimization tool for Windows 10/11, designed for remote execution and comprehensive network performance enhancement. This script modernizes and expands upon traditional network optimization techniques with advanced PowerShell features, safety mechanisms, and enterprise-ready deployment capabilities.

## üöÄ Quick Start (Remote Execution)

Execute the network optimizer directly from GitHub without downloading files:

```powershell
# Basic execution (recommended method)
$webClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $webClient.Encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8; iex $webClient.DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cykeek/Win10-Network-Tuning/main/NetworkOptimizer.ps1")

# Alternative shorter method (may have encoding issues on some systems)
iex (irm "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cykeek/Win10-Network-Tuning/main/NetworkOptimizer.ps1")

# Silent mode with recommended settings
$webClient = New-Object System.Net.WebClient; $webClient.Encoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8; $script = $webClient.DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cykeek/Win10-Network-Tuning/main/NetworkOptimizer.ps1"); iex "& { $script } -Silent"

# Preview mode (show changes without applying)
